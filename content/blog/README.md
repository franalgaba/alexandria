## Key Themes

### Technical Innovation
- Checkpoint-driven extraction (Post 3)
- Git-aware staleness detection (Post 6)
- Tiered curation with zero-config LLM access (Posts 2, 3)

### Architectural Philosophy
- Local-first, privacy-preserving (Post 5)
- SQLite for everything (Post 8)
- Simplicity over complexity (Posts 7, 10)

### Honest Assessment
- Benchmark transparency (Posts 4, 10)

- Honest about trade-offs
- Opinionated but reasoned

### Structure
- Hook in first paragraph
- Clear thesis statement
- Code snippets with context
- Data when available
- Clear call to action

### SEO Keywords
- AI memory systems
- Coding agents
- Claude Code
- Local-first AI
- LLM memory
- AI development tools
